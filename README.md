# 🧠 Flip It - Memory Card Game
Flip It is a small game we built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It's based on the memory game where players flip cards and try to find matching pairs.

The goal is to match all the cards as fast as possible and with the fewest reveals.

# 🎮 How to Play
- Open the game
- Chhose a difficulty level
- CLick on cards to flip them
- Flip two cards
    - If they match -> they stay open
    - If they don't -> the flip back after a second
- Match all pairs to win
  Players can track their progress using the timer and reveal counter.
